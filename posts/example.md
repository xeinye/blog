## The quick brown fox
The earliest known appearance of the phrase was in The Boston Journal. In an
article titled "Current Notes" in the February 9, 1885, edition, the phrase is
mentioned as a good practice sentence for writing students: "A favorite copy set
by writing teachers for their pupils is the following, because it contains every
letter of the alphabet: 'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"[2] Dozens
of other newspapers published the phrase over the next few months, all using the
version of the sentence starting with "A" rather than "The".[3] The earliest
known use of the phrase starting with "The" is from the 1888 book Illustrative
Shorthand by Linda Bronson.[4] The modern form (starting with "The") became more
common even though it is slightly longer than the original (starting with "A").

A 1908 edition of the Los Angeles Herald Sunday Magazine records that when the
New York Herald was equipping an office with typewriters "a few years ago",
staff found that the common practice sentence of "now is the time for all good
men to come to the aid of the party" did not familiarize typists with the entire
alphabet, and ran onto two lines in a newspaper column. They write that a staff
member named Arthur F. Curtis invented the "quick brown fox" pangram to address
this.[5]
